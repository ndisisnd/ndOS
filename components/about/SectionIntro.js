        Hey there, I’m Andy. I’m a designer, writer, and self-proclaimed
        engineer. I’m currently designing the subscription experience at
        foodpanda, a food delivery app present in APAC and EU.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before foodpanda, I was a product manager at Polymerize. I also had my
        fair share of designing e-commerce and SaaS applications in various
        startups.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also write From a Junior, a weekly newsletter about design,
        psychology, and other less conventional thoughts. I love writing about
        design and I publish regularly on Medium.
